These plugins add https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/component_capabilities.html#capabilities_as_first_level_concept[dependency capabilities]
to the metadata of well-known components hosted on Maven Central that are used in many Java projects.
They also provide ways to resolve the potential capability conflict that can happen in the dependency graph of your application.

* Ever seen this infamous Slf4J warning?

----
SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:.../slf4j-log4j12-1.7.29.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:.../logback-classic-1.2.3.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.
SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]

* Ever wondered how to make sure _all_ your dependencies' logging ends up in your Log4J 2 configured outputs?
* Ever had to handle a `javax` to `jakarta` migration and wondered how to make sure all your dependencies are compatible?

In the videos below, https://github.com/jjohannes[Jendrik] explains the concept of Capability Conflicts and why they can help you to avoid "dependency hell" in your project.

NOTE: With these plugins, you enable your build to detect and automatically resolve typical capability conflicts in the JVM ecosystem.

== Plugins Overview

TIP: These plugins require Gradle 6.8.3 at a minimum.

The benefits described above are achieved through two plugins:

`org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-detection`::
<<detection-plugin,This plugin>> adds capability declarations to the metadata of well-known components hosted on Maven Central that are used in many Java projects.
This plugin can be applied as a `Settings` or a `Project` plugin.

`org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution`::
<<resolution-plugin,This plugin>> adds opinionated capability resolutions to conflicting API or implementation libraries in the JVM ecosystem.
This plugin can be applied as a `Project` plugin.
It adds a DSL to configure resolution strategies, select logging implementations, and fix/enhance metadata of published components.

See each plugin's documentation for more details.

TIP: The `org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution` extends the `org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-detection` plugin.
In most projects, you can apply only `org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution` to get all functionality.

[[appendix]]
== Appendix

[[all-capabilities]]
=== Appendix A: All Capabilities

The following list shows all capabilities and the components they are added to.
Most capabilities use `org.gradlex` as group and the name of the Component that first introduced the capability.
For capabilities that already exists because they are mentioned in published metadata (like `com.google.collections:google-collections`) the official capability groups and names are used.

=== Appendix B: Capabilities for logging

The following lists the capabilities important for the logging topic (see <<logging-dsl-block, logging DSL block>>).

|===
| Capability | Impacted modules | Comment

| `slf4j-impl`
| `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`, `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-nop`
| Represents an Slf4J binding

| `log4j2-impl`
| `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`
| Represents the native Log4J 2 implementation or delegation to Slf4J

| `log4j2-vs-slf4j`
| `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j`
| Represents the Slf4J / Log4J 2 relationship: which one delegates to the other

| `slf4j-vs-log4j`
| `org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`
| Represents the Slf4J / Log4J 1.2 relationship: either Slf4J intercepts or binds to Log4J

| `slf4j-vs-log4j2-log4j`
| `org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-1.2-api`, `log4j:log4j`
| Represents the available Log4J implementation: native, with Slf4J or with Log4J 2

| `slf4j-vs-jul`
| `org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`
| Represents the Slf4J / `java.util.logging` relationship: either Slf4 intercepts or binds to JUL

| `slf4j-vs-log4j2-jul`
| `org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jul`
| Represents JUL replacement: either with Slf4J or with Log4J 2

| `commons-logging-impl`
| `commons-logging:commons-logging`, `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `org.springframework:spring-jcl`
| Represents Apache Commons Logging implementation: native or Slf4J

| `slf4j-vs-jcl`
| `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl`
| Represents the Slf4J / Apache Commons Logging relationship: either Slf4J intercepts or binds to `commons-logging`

| `slf4j-vs-log4j2-jcl`
| `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jcl`
| Represents the Slf4J or Log4J 2 interception of `commons-logging`

=== Appendix C: Alignment

In addition to the capability setting and conflict detection, the plugin also registers https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_version_alignment.html#sec:align-versions-virtual[alignment rules] for Slf4J and Log4J 2 modules.
